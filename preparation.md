# Programs to install

We will be using the following software programs during class. The programs are all open-source and cross platform (win/mac/linux).

* R: [http://www.r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/)
* Rstudio: [http://rstudio.org/](http://rstudio.org/)
* QGIS: [http://www.qgis.org/](http://www.qgis.org/)

Install `R` first, then install `RStudio`. After you install `R` try downloading and installing a package by pasting the following line into the command line editor:

	install.packages('ggplot2')	
	
Install `sp` and `maptools` also using the same command. For example:

	install.packages('sp')	
	# do the same for 'maptools'
	
Please check that you can open `QGIS` also. When installing, there is no need to choose the sample datasets provided.

### ggplot2

[ggplot2](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/) is a visualization and analysis package for R. We are going to use it to illustrate how multiple dimensions of measurement can be shown on a plot, and to illustrate how data can be grouped. 

### sp / Maptools

These packages enable plotting of spatial data directly in `R`. Depending on how much time we have in class we may not use them but I will include instructions about their use.
